This repository contains code that uses the PyMC Python package to fit model parameters to the data in the paper "Long-term homeostasis in microbial consortia via auxotrophic cross-feeding."

The files "Auxotroph-nonaut-phase1.ipynb" and "Auxotroph-nonaut-phase2.ipynb" contain the code used to obtain parameter values used in the main text, as well as produce Figures S5 and S6. The file "Auxotroph-autonomous-06-01-2025" is used to produce Figure S8.
